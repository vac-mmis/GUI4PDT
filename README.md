## Description

MMIS GUI for PDT project aims at providing a visualization for Probabilistic Digital-Twins (PDT) in the [OTC-DaTA project (de)](https://www.mmis.informatik.uni-rostock.de/research/projects/otc-data/) supported by [the chair of Mobile Multimedia Information Systems](https://www.mmis.informatik.uni-rostock.de/) at the University of Rostock.

## Architecture

This full Typescript application is split in two parts :

-   A REST API backend powered by [Express.JS](https://expressjs.com) provides PDT data based on JSON files. Please go to [backend README üìù](/backend/README.md) to get more information about it.
-   The main [Vue](https://vuejs.org) user-interface base on [Three.JS](https://threejs.org/) Web 3D visualization framework. Details are available in the [frontend README üìù](/frontend/README.md).
