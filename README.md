## Description

MMIS GUI for PDT project aims at providing a visualization for Probabilistic Digital-Twins (PDT) in the [OTC-DaTA project (de)](https://www.mmis.informatik.uni-rostock.de/research/projects/otc-data/) supported by [the chair of Mobile Multimedia Information Systems](https://www.mmis.informatik.uni-rostock.de/) at the University of Rostock.

## Architecture

This full Typescript application is split in two parts :

-   A REST API backend powered by [Express.JS](https://expressjs.com) provides PDT data based on JSON files. Please go to [backend README üìù](/backend/README.md) to get more information about it.
-   The main [Vue](https://vuejs.org) user-interface base on [Three.JS](https://threejs.org/) Web 3D visualization framework. Details are available in the [frontend README üìù](/frontend/README.md).

## Installation

### Deployment with Docker Compose

This project could be easily deployed with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Here is some common CLI used to deploy the app :

Build images

```sh
docker compose build
```

Run containers

```sh
docker compose up
```

Run as daemon

### Manual installation and local running

As this application is split in two parts, it requires two separate installation or local running. Therefore, please refer to the dedicated documentation of each part :

### Generate documentation webpage

A documentation webpage could be generated thanks to [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev) and [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) :

```sh
npm run docs:gen    # Generate documentation Markdown pages in docs folder.
npm run docs:dev    # Show doc webpage with dynamic render.
```

Docs webpage would be available at [localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174).

It is also possible to build docs website without running Vitepress :

```sh
npm run docs:gen        # Needed if documentation is not yet generated or not to update.
npm run docs:build      # Build documentation webpage, ready to be served.

npm run docs:preview    # Preview built docs webpage.
```

Preview is available at [localhost:4174](http://localhost:4174).
