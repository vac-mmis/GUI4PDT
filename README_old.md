## Architecture

This full Typescript application is split in two parts :

-   A REST API backend powered by [Express.JS](https://expressjs.com) provides PDT data based on JSON files. Please go to [backend README üìù](/backend/README.md) to get more information about it.
-   The main [Vue](https://vuejs.org) user-interface base on [Three.JS](https://threejs.org/) Web 3D visualization framework. Details are available in the [frontend README üìù](/frontend/README.md).

## Contribute

### Generate documentation webpage

A documentation webpage could be generated thanks to [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev) and [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) :

```sh
npm run docs:gen    # Generate documentation Markdown pages in docs folder.
npm run docs:dev    # Show doc webpage with dynamic render.
```

Docs webpage would be available at [localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174).

It is also possible to build docs website without running Vitepress :

```sh
npm run docs:gen        # Needed if documentation is not yet generated or not to update.
npm run docs:build      # Build documentation webpage, ready to be served.

npm run docs:preview    # Preview built docs webpage.
```

Preview is available at [localhost:4174](http://localhost:4174).
